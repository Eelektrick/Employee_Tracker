# Issues

This project was more time consuming than anticipated.

Created many functions to operate a simple choices and table to create the information provided.

Many new things I had to learn to utilize all function together.

Using async and await was a tough thing at first but when using on multiple functions

the idea was better understood.

made alot of small errors dealing with over 600 lines of code that I had to 

go back and fix to stop the errors from popping up.
